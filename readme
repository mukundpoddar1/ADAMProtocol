Probable issues:
Thread Safety
It can increase MTX multiple times if 6mp and mtx are greatly out of sync
If a new tolerated has been set that may be below 100Dose, the calculations are still being done on 100% 
It will never be able to consistently dose below the tolerated dose. Hence, if something got set as a tolerated dose erroneously, it will keep trying to give that.
All decisions are being made in terms of number of days and not number of visits. Hence if there were no visits for a long time, system will not recognise that and can give wrong judgements.

Tolerated Dose:
Highest value that has been given to the patient for at least 6 weeks.
Usage:
reset to this after any decrease

Hundred dose:
BSA dose.
Usage:
every dose increase is 15% of this

Last Dose:
Whatever was given to the patient in their previous visit
Usage:
Decrease on this.

Suggestions for future modifications on software front:
Make a visit class that combines data about count and dose. Patient only has Vector of Visit then, which should be sortable by dates of visits. This way adding a visit asynchronously becomes possible.
Convert dose class to only store percentages. Patient class will be in charge of making this % into an absolute.

Requirements of system:
Start date
Bsa
tolerated dose
last 12 weeks: date, neutrophils, platelets, doses 

Options to show for prescription:
0, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, Max tolerated

Things to change for format:
Remove times
Convert to csv
Sort by order of visits
Ensure naming of file
Fill in doses
Fill in start dates
